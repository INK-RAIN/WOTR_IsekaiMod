# Isekai Mod
This is a content mod for `Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous` that adds an `Isekai Protagonist` Class into the game.
## Development Guide
### Requirements
- Visual Studio 2019 (You can use the latest version if you know what you're doing)
### Setup
- Add `WrathPath` as an environment variable with the value `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Pathfinder Second Adventure` or wherever your game directory is.
- Open Visual Studio and [publicize your assemblies](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki/Publicize-Assemblies) (`SolutionDir` can be replaced with `WrathPath`).
### Testing
- Create a folder called `IsekaiMod` in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Pathfinder Second Adventure\Mods`.
- After building your solution in Visual Studio, go to your project directory -> `bin` -> `Release` or `Debug` -> `IsekaiMod` -> `net472`.
- Copy the files and folders from the image below and place them in the folder you created (ignore `UserSettings`).

- Create the `UserSettings` folder here and copy the `AddedContent.json` and the `Blueprints.json` files from the project and place them in this `UserSettings` folder.
- Now you can start your game and test.

On subsequent tests you'll only need to copy the `IsekaiMod.dll`.
- If you edited the blueprint names, copy `Blueprints.json` as well.
- If you added new assets, copy those as well.
